## Installation
1. Clone or fork the repository.

## Kinsta Static Site Hosting Setup
### Dependency Management

Kinsta automatically installs dependencies defined in your `package.json` file during the deployment process.

### Setting the Build Command, Node version, and Publish directory

After connecting the repository, **Static Site Hosting** will automatically try to populate all the fields with the correct values.
| Configuration option |Value     |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| Build command     | `npm run build` |
| Node version      | 16.20.0         |
| Publish directory | `public`        |


### Deployment Lifecycle

Whenever a deployment is initiated (through creating an application or re-deploying due to an incoming commit), the build command is run, followed by the deployment of the Publish Directory content.
